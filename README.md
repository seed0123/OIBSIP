    <h2>ATM.java</h2>
    <p>This project is based on simple java Command Line application of an ATM Interface </p>
    <p>An ATM consists of some basuc operations like :</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Deposting Money</li>
        <li>Withdrawing Money</li>
        <li>Checking Balance </li>
        <li>Transferring Money</li>
    </ul>
    <p>All these are done by using simple java command line application</p>
    <p>Using the ATM.java code you can access all these functions in CLI</p>
    <hr>
    <h2>GuessTheNumber.java</h2>
    <p>This is based on simple CLI of an Random Number Guessing Game</p>
    <p>This can be used to gueess the number between a maximum and minimum number</p>
    <p>Further we are giving some points for valide Guessing of the number</p>
    <p>It consists of rounds at which we may able to continue or discontinue using users choice</p>
    <hr>
 <h2>CONCLUSION</h2>
 <p>Thus all these projects are used to achieve the CLI for ATM and Guess the Number </p>
